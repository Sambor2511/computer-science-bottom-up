### C Grammar

There are five kinds of brackets: { ... }, ( ... ), [ ... ], /* ... */, and < ... >.
There are two different separators or terminators: comma and semicolon.
Comment in C is /* ... */.

Literals: Our program contains several items that refer to fixed values that are part of the
program: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9.0, 2.9, 3.E+25, .00007, and
"element␣%zu␣is␣%g,␣\tits␣square␣is␣%g\n". These are called literalsC.

Identifiers: These are “names” that we (or the C standard) give to certain entities in
the program. Here we have A, i, main, printf, size_t, and EXIT_SUCCESS.

Functions: Two of the identifiers refer to functions: main and printf. printf is used by the program to produce some output. The function
main in turn is defined: that is, its declaration int main(void) is followed by a block enclosed in { ... } that describes what that function is supposed to do.

Operators: Of the numerous C operators, our program only uses a few:
• = for initializationC and assignment,
• < for comparison,
• ++ to increment a variable (to increase its value by 1), and
• * to multiply two values.

### Declarations

Before we may use a particular identifier in a program, we have to
give the compiler a declaration that specifies what that identifier is supposed to represent.
This is where identifiers differ from keywords: keywords are predefined by the language
and must not be declared or redefined.
